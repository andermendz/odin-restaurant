# Webpack Restaurant Page

This project is a simple restaurant homepage, built by dynamically rendering content using JavaScript modules and webpack. The project demonstrates the ability to set up a JavaScript project with webpack.

## Features

- **Tabbed browsing**: The site uses tabbed browsing to access different content like Home, Menu, and Contact. Each tab's content is stored in its own module.
- **Dynamic content rendering**: All the contents of the page are generated using JavaScript. On page load, JavaScript is used to create and append new elements to the DOM.
- **Webpack**: The project is bundled using webpack. Webpack configuration file is set up similar to the one in the webpack tutorial.

## Setup

The project setup involves initializing npm in the project directory, installing webpack and webpack-cli as dev dependencies, and creating a .gitignore file for the node_modules directory. The project structure includes a src directory with an index.js file and a dist directory with an index.html file.

## Deployment

The project is set up for deployment on GitHub pages. A script is added to the package.json file to push the dist folder to the gh-pages branch of the repository.
